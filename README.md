# SGMI-FS
Scalable Global Mutual Information-based Feature Selection Framework (SGMI).
This is a new feature selection framework to cope with large-scale datasets in the distributed environment. The SGMI framework generates the similarity matrix in a distributed and scalable way and in a single pass. Then, it applies an optimization method, such as QP, SR, TP, to find a global solution in order to make a ranking of features. 
QP => Quadratic Programming
SR => Spectral Relaxation
TP => Truncate Power
